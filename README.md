# About

A simple text log for [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg), using webhooks to output to a Discord channel.

# How To

Download and run the .exe from github releases. Set it up with the `config.json` file. You will need a Discord webhook
URL.

You can set up its own slot for the bot with "Archipelago" as the game. Or you can just use one of your existing slots. It
makes no difference.
